# TV Script Generation
This is Udacity - Deep Learning Project 3 - Generate TV Script.  
In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs.  
You'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. 
The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
